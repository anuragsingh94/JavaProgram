Scanner class is used to take input from the user.
The conditional operator (also known as the ternary operator ? :) is used to check if the entered character is a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase).
If the character is a vowel, it will print "Vowel". Otherwise, it will print "Not a vowel".
We check both lowercase and uppercase vowels in the condition (a, e, i, o, u and A, E, I, O, U).
